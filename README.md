# The Crystal Collector
The rules are simple: Click the crystals and add the points up without going over the target score. The trick lies with the crystals, which are assigned a random value with every game. Be careful where you click!

# Overview
The Crystal Collector game is single page app that utilizes jQuery for its functionality. The code that operates the game is written in a modular fashion, making the path of the code easy to follow.

# Instructions
All game play happens on a single page. At the start, the player is given a random number at the start of the game.

There are four crystals. Each crystal is assigned a random value between the numbers of 1 and 12. By clicking on a crystal, you will add that number to the total score.

To win the game, the player's total score has to equal the randomly chosen number showing on the screen. It the player's total score goes above that number, the player loses. 

As soon as a game is either won or lost, a new target score is generated, and one is added to the number of wins or losses.
